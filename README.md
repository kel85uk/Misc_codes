==========

All other codes that are done for courseworks and personal fun

MAE727_HW1: Code to calculate the equilibrium species mole fraction and concentrations for any chemical reactions. Input data are from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database, and Molecular Spectral Database
FEEP_PID_Heater: C Code to hook a User-Defined Function source into FLUENT (A commercial CFD package now owned by Ansys). Source is a heater which has inherent PID controller. This can serve as an example for possible fluid simulations to tune PID parameters for actual machines.
